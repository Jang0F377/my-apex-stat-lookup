# My Apex Stat Lookup
## For Apex players Rookie - Vet.

Typescript, Next.JS, website that will return detailed apex stats about the player. This has been my favorite project, I hope you enjoy it! :)
  * Home page you can look up a person's stats on PS/Xbox/PC by gamertag.
  * Map Rotation Tab offers a look at the current map for all game modes and approximate time of length until rotation.
  * Crafter Tab shows what is currently in the crafter (I know I always forget!).
  * Blog/News tab currently just has news (potential blog posts in progress).


# Technologies Used:
* Typescript
* Next.JS
* Consumes API from Apex Legends Status
  * Big shout out to Hugo for creating/maintaining the api.
* Tailwind CSS

# Main Hurdle
* First time working with that size of JSON object. So creating interfaces for the data and properly
parsing and displaying it.
